**Contributions to documentation are very welcome!**

If you can contribute to documentation, please just do it. If you spotted a mistake, there's no need to opne an issue. Just file the changes directly to master (for current version) or to the "main" branch of the next version, if your changes regards that.

Otherwise, if you can't do changes yourself, please open an issue only if you think the issue is relevant, and avoid opening an issue for a single typo fix or a missing space or things like that.
